		Error: Function ${function_name} no longer exposed

		The buildpack you're using is likely employing Heroku's jvm-common
		buildpack to install OpenJDK.

		Your buildpack is using the bash function ${function_name} which is no
		longer exposed in the latest release of Heroku's jvm-common buildpack.
		If you didn't upgrade anything, it's likely that your buildpack is
		implicitly using the latest release of Heroku's jvm-common buildpack.

		Your buildpack needs changes to continue to work. In most cases

		install_openjdk "\${BUILD_DIR}" "\${BUILDPACK_DIR}"

		should be sufficient to install OpenJDK. Please refer to jvm-common's
		README.md file for a complete usage example:
