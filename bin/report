#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Usage: bin/report <build-dir> <cache-dir> <env-dir>

# Produces a build report containing metadata about the build, that's consumed by the build system.
# This script is run for both successful and failing builds, so it should not assume the build ran
# to completion (e.g. OpenJDK may not even have been installed).
#
# Metadata must be emitted to stdout as valid YAML key-value pairs. Any fields that should always
# be typed as a string must be explicitly quoted.
#
# Example valid stdout:
#   openjdk_version: 'X.Y.Z'
#   openjdk_install_duration: 1.234
#
# Failures in this script don't cause the overall build to fail (and won't appear in user
# facing build logs) to avoid breaking builds unnecessarily / causing confusion. To debug
# issues check the internal build system logs for `buildpack.report.failed` events, or
# when developing run `make compile` in this repo locally, which runs `bin/report` too.

# There is no reporting at this point in time. It will be implemented later.
